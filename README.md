# BlazingMQ Python SDK

This repository provides the official Python client library, as well as examples
of how applications can interact with BlazingMQ. BlazingMQ is an open source
message queue system, which focuses on efficiency, reliability, and a rich feature
set. Please see the BlazingMQ [repo](https://github.com/bloomberg/blazingmq)
and [documentation](https://bloomberg.github.io/blazingmq) for more details
about BlazingMQ.

This Python client is fully supported by the BlazingMQ team, and we intend to
provide feature and/or API parity with the BlazingMQ C++ client library.
